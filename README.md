# Installation
You must have Python version 3.* installed.

# 2.Project Motivation.
For this project, I was interested in using the 2017 Stack Overflow data to better understand:

Question 1: How does job satisfaction behave?

Question 2: If a person has high satisfaction for a career (CareerSatisfaction), will they also have high satisfaction for their job (JobSatisfaction)?

Question 3: What qualitative and quantitative variables influence an employee to have high JobSatisfaction?

# 3.File descriptions
In first measure there is a file with those of Stack Overflow of 2017 that are necsary at the time of database loading, in second half there is a .py Jupyter Python File, where in the initial part gives a general outline of the structure of the database, in the three subsequent sections answers the previous questions by descriptive analysis, simple linear model and multiple linear model with categorical variables.

# 4. Results
The main findings of the code can be found in the publication available at https://gustavovenegas2010.github.io/Proyecto-1/ .
